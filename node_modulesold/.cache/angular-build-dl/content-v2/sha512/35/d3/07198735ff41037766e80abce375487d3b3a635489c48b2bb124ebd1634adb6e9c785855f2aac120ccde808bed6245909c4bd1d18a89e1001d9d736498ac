The Pet Owner must notify PetCloud in writing at service@petcloud.com.au . Petcloud’s representative will consider notice receipt time, circumstances of the complaints, withholding period of booking amount, sitter’s refund policy or any other relevant factors before processing any refunds. Three types of refund policies which a sitter, as a provider of pet care services, can choose are below;<br>						<strong>Conditions for FULL Refunds:</strong><br>						<strong>Flexible Policy:</strong> Pet owner is eligible for a full refund if PetCloud receives the cancellation request 24hours before the commencement of the booking.<br>						<strong>Moderate Policy:</strong> Pet owner is eligible for a full refund if PetCloud receives the cancellation request <u>7 days before</u> the start of a booking.<br>						<strong>Strict Policy:</strong> Pet owner is eligible for a full refund if PetCloud receives the cancellation request <u>14 days before</u> the start of a booking.<br>						<strong>Capped Partial Refunds:</strong> Where a Pet Owner is not eligible for a full refund, PetCloud will forfeit 50% or A$300 whichever is lower over and above $20 cancellation fee. This is a cost to cover Pet Siter’s compensation, administration expenses to set the booking, maintenance of website, advertising, training and other related costs.<br>						If a pet owner cancels a current booking (after the start but before the end date), we will refund the booking fees paid by the pet owner for the services not yet provided subject to a $20 cancellation fee and the Capped Partial Refunds clause above.<br>						<strong>Refunds after a payout:</strong> Sitter will get paid after a pet owner confirms completion of a booking on PetCloud or after 3 business days after completion. Cancellation request/complaints received after payment has been made to the Pet Sitter will warrant discussions with both parties and will involve recovery of paid funds from the sitter. PetCloud will pay to the Pet Owner only after receiving money back from the sitter, Pet Owner understand that any delays are beyond the control of PetCloud.<br>					</li>					<li><strong>Cancellation of Recurring Bookings:</strong> weekly recurring bookings that run for more than 2 weeks and for which Pet Cloud collects weekly payments. All the above policies will apply in cases where booking is cancelled before its start date except the amount in consideration will be for 2 weeks.					</li>                </ul>				<p><strong>Force Majeure:</strong> The cancellation policies described herein may not apply in the event of certain emergency situations beyond the control of Pet Sitters and/or Pet Owners that make it impossible or impractical to perform agreed Bookings, such as evacuations resulting from earthquake, hurricane, bushfire, flood, war, riots, pandemic situation or other similar disaster. In such cases PetCloud may, in its reasonable discretion, issue refunds under terms that vary from a Pet Sitter’s selected cancellation policy.</p>			</div>',
